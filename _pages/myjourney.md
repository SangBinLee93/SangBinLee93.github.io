Chung-Ang University, Film Major (Double - Economics), Barchelor of Arts.

I made two live-action short films.

**2nd grade**’s film was “The Last Christmas”.

And that was quite a challenging first experience.

**3rd grade**’s film was “Making Film”.

I contracted with distributor, (c)Funnycon. 
With this film, I could see my movie at JamSil Lotte Cinema, which is one of the most populer Cinema in Korea.

During my last year of school, I had a strong desire to create my final movie. I dedicated over 3 years to perfecting it. However, I was unable to accomplish my goal. The main reason behind this was my lack of a meaningful message for society. I felt trapped and unable to progress.

# 2021.03 ~ 2021.05

So, I decided to go another way and focus on what I do well. I was really good at using software, including premiere pro, final cut pro, after effects, photoshop, and davinci resolve. Also, my interest has always been with imaginary worlds, such as fantasy, science fiction, and animation. So, during 4 months, I learned the software Maya, and after graduation, during next 3 months, I made my reel, and I could get a job.

Initially, the president of Studio EON asked me to join the directing team since the assistant director had resigned and a replacement team was needed. That was a good experience because I've never earned money with my ability in film before.

And after 3 months, the number of workers in the directing team increased to 3 people. So, I could be a junior rigger finally. I learned skinning, rigging, python, and unreal engine.

The president of Studio EON wanted to create teasers for three projects, and I wanted to help him achieve this goal. Whenever there were any problems, I would listen and solve them with various ideas. Additionally, I was able to provide guidance on technical issues including Xgen, Faceware, nHair, nCloth, ControlRig, and so on.

I wanted to learn more about Maya rigging, and feature Animation Production. So I worked with Studio MIR. I thought they were focused on 2D, but they were also skilled in 3D. Sometimes, they reproduce 2D lines using 3D assets. So the shape of 3D asset was very important.

The head of the rigging team taught me anatomy and Maya sculpting skills. These work experiences have helped me understand why rigger is called rigging “Artist”. And when new juniors and interns joined my team, I was able to educate and guide them.

One day, I received a Canadian work permit, so I wanted to prepare myself in terms of English language skills and my demo reel. This made me feel rushed, but then the head manager of GIANTSTEP suggested that he could help me create an impressive reel within 6 months. He advised me to come to GIANTSTEP and prepare for my Canadian Working Holiday.

At the first time, when I get into GIANTSTEP, I learned yeti basics from pipeline TD, tea-young Song. His knowledge about yeti was so great, so I could understand the current status about GIANTSTEP’s pipeline. I suggested to modify GIANTSTEP’s pipeline, more accurate with rest-pose, uv, and guide curve set datas.

After one month, I started work with LostArk Project. I managed all hair datas from all outsourcing companies. I reviewed their errors, retouched the hair curves. However, they also produced main shots but the quality was not enough. I suggested for my manager to give me a opportunity to work on the hair simulation for the shots. So, I could start working with the Kamen's helmet shot, which is the most important shot in the entire timeline.

When I created the hair simulation for the shot, I utilized Houdini's Vellum and VEX Wrangle nodes. I had studied houdini because I heard houdini is the most powerful tool with simulation, and I wanted to focus on cfx work in this company. It wasn't easy, but I never gave up. 

As I created the shot’s hair simulation, my vice president, who was the head of the LostArk project, watched my work and loved it. I was so happy. I added my opinion, "How about adding this tiny short hair before the main hair comes out? I believe this would not only enhance realism but also add a stylistic touch through gradual expression”. And then, he gave me a comment, "Perfect.”
