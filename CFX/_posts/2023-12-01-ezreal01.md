Houdini Cloth Simulation

{% include video id="UR5hej3MfvE" provider="youtube" %}

- My Own Style of Houdini Cloth Simulation.
- [Pipeline] Alembic -> Vellum Pack / Solver / IO -> ROP-Alembic

Unfortunately, recently I couldn't work with character's high-quality cloth simulation, so I wanted to show I can work with Houdini cloth vellum simulation.
I couldn't learn any pipeline but, I think I made reusable alembic pipeline.

This is still in progress. Further information will be added.
