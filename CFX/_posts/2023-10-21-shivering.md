yeti shivering problem solving experience.

Outsourcing company gave me this shivering data.

I assumed that curves' data is not fitting for yeti.

It was certain that the root points are the problem.

I could understand they give me this data because of collision evaluation.
Talking to my production manager with this problem, I could solve the problems.
